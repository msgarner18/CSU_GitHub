Thamesmead<====>94316<====>Thamesmead    Thamesmead   is a suburb of south London in the London Boroughs of Greenwich and Bexley. It is situated   east of Charing Cross, and includes a group of disparate developments, mainly social housing, built from the mid-1960s onwards, mostly on former marshland on the south bank of the River Thames, between the established towns of Woolwich and Belvedere.  History  Military use Most of the land area of Thamesmead previously formed about   of the old Royal Arsenal site that extended over Plumstead Marshes and Erith Marshes. There is some evidence of prehistoric human occupation of the area: flints, animal bones and charcoal were found in bore holes around Western and Central Way in 1997 by the Museum of London Archaeological Service (MOLAS). Museum of London Archaeological Service site summaries 1997, accessed 27 May 2008  In Roman times, the river level was significantly lower, and work by MOLAS in 1997 around Summerton Way revealed evidence of field ditches and pottery and quernstones from Germany dating from around the 3rd or 4th century. After the Roman era, river levels rose again and the area reverted to marshland. Museum of London Archaeological Service site summaries 1997, accessed 27 May 2008  According to Hasted, some areas of this marshland were drained by 1279 by the monks of Lesnes AbbeyBetween 1812 and 1816, a canal was built by convicts to take materials such as timber from the River Thames to Woolwich Royal Arsenal. Much of this canal has been filled in, but part remains in Thamesmead West and is now called the Broadwater. Greater London Industrial Archaeology Society, notes from Bob Carr October 1992, accessed 27 May 2008  A disused lock gate and swing bridge over the canal still exist beside the River Thames. Efforts were made to solve the social problems that had already started to affect earlier estates. These were believed to be the result of people being uprooted from close-knit working-class communities and sent to estates many miles away, where they did not know anybody. The design of the estates meant that people would see their neighbours more rarely than they would have done in the terraced housing that had been typical in working-class areas. The solution proposed was that once the initial residents had moved in, their families would be given priority for new housing when it became availableAnother radical idea of the GLC division architect Robert Rigg was taken from housing complexes in Sweden, where it was believed that lakes and canals reduced vandalism and other crime, mainly among the young. He used water as a calming influence on the residents.    Thamesmead was designed around futuristic ideas, and indeed, looked impressive at first from a distance. It was provided walkways between its blocks of housing and later between sections in North Thamesmead. The walkways quickly became littered and abused. They were not considered safe places to walk. Pathways set out for people to walk on were put in without regard to how people would wish to get about, so some were ignored in favour of more direct routes over grassed areasMuch of Thamesmead was initially built by the Greater London Council (GLC) for rent to families moving from overcrowded back-to-back Victorian housing (also referred to as slums) in south eastern parts of Inner London. The area had been inundated in the North Sea Flood of 1953, so the original design placed living accommodation at first floor level or above, used overhead walkways and left the ground level of buildings as garage space. The first residence was occupied in 1968, but already there were rain penetration problems.  The pre-1974 parts of Thamesmead are a mix of modernist town houses, medium-rise and 12-storey blocks system-built in concrete, which have featured in various films due to their 'rough urban look'; the design of the newer buildings is more traditional and in brick. Thamesmead, A Potted History, by Marc Anderson, on Greenwich 2000 website, originally from Thamesmead Gazette July 1995, accessed 27 May 2008 When the GLC was abolished in 1986, its housing assets and the remaining undeveloped land were vested in a non-profit organisation, Thamesmead Town Limited (TTL). TTL was a private company with an unusual form of governance . Its nine executive directors were local residents; they periodically submitted themselves to re-election. Problems of the original designDespite early proposals for the Jubilee Line Extension to go to Thamesmead,  via the Isle of Dogs and the Royal Docks, Thamesmead was not included and after reaching the Greenwich Peninsula, the line heads north to Stratford (via Canning Town and West Ham), despite Stratford also being on the major Central line tube link into London. The main reason cited for this decision was that many workers in Canary Wharf lived in Essex and could change from National Rail to the Jubilee line at Stratford and West HamThamesmead is also cut off from the north of the River Thames and is in the centre of the 15 mile gap between the Blackwall Tunnel and the Dartford Tunnel/QE2 Bridge. Various proposals have been made for a new river crossing, the closest of which was in the late 1980s, when there was a controversial proposal to alter the shape of London's South Circular inner orbital road to run through Oxleas Woods. Houses in Plumstead were compulsorily purchased but the plans fell through. Since then, Thamesmead has grown significantly, limiting the number of potential sites for a new river crossingThe most significant design failure was the almost complete lack of shopping facilities and banks: only a few "corner shops" were initially built at Tavy Bridge. Still, residential building continued, this time on the other side of the A2016, which cut this part of Thamesmead off from rail travel to central LondonOver time more facilities developed, with a Morrisons supermarket and retail park near Gallions Reach. Bus services were improved and residents can now easily reach Abbey Wood railway station. 21st centuryIn 2000, TTL was wound down and two new organisations were formed. In broad terms, Gallions Housing Association took over the ownership and management of the housing assets whilst Tilfen, later Tilfen Land, took over the remaining undeveloped land. Tilfen is jointly owned by Gallions and Trust Thamesmead. Thamesmead History on Trust Thamesmead website accessed 27 May 2008 District heating and cable radio broadcasting were pioneered in Thamesmead. The District heating system was decommissioned around the year 2000; properties connected to it had wet radiator systems installed by the landlordThe Tavy Bridge area is now being redeveloped by Gallions in partnership with Wates Group; the plans include homes with dwelling space at ground floor level, making them susceptible to any future flooding. Thamesmead now features a retail park finished in brick anchored around a Morrisons Supermarket; there is also a shopping parade which has mainly service-based outlets such as hairdressers and estate agents. It features a clock tower and lake. Some of the original overhead pedestrian walkways have been demolished for reasons of public safety and some ground floor garages have been unfilled, as incidents of crime deterred their use as parking spaceTrust Thamesmead is a registered charity set up to provide community services across Thamesmead. It runs six community centres and runs a variety of projects promoting social development and work and training projects. 'About Us' on Trust Thamesmead website, accessed 27 May 2008 Thamesmead West contains Gallions Ecopark Gallions Ecopark in Thamesmead  a pioneering small social/affordable housing development with homes built to high energy efficiency and environmental standards. The estate also includes a small lake and Gallions Hill (viewpoint hill). Part of Thamesmead West is also sometimes referred to as "Gallions Reach Urban Village". This can lead to confusion, as it is on the opposite bank of the River Thames from Gallions Reach DLR station and Gallions Reach shopping park. There is no Docklands Light Railway, London Underground or rail station in Thamesmead WestEarly 21st century new build properties in Thamesmead West have been blighted by social problems and mass repossessions, Financial Times Article - October 2008 - "Requiem for a dream home"  attracting national attention.  Housing is still under construction both by Gallions Housing Association (for rent and part rent/part buy) and by private developers (for outright sale). The final phase of the Gallions Reach Urban Village (ecopark) is the creation of Gallions Reach Park (a 143 acre, public open space land, between Gallions Hill and the River Thames).  Water remains an important feature of the several parks and open spacesIn November 2007, Bexley Council marked Thamesmead's 40th birthday with a motion proposed by local Councillor David Leaf and seconded by Councillor John DaveyIn 2014, Gallions, Tilfen Land and Trust Thamesmead were taken over by Peabody Trust, a London housing association.  In 2015, two Housing Zones in Thamesmead were announced by the Mayor of London for delivery of 2,800 homes. The zones are Abbey Wood and South Thamesmead, between Abbey Wood station and Southmere Lake, and Abbey Wood, Plumstead and Thamesmead. The buildings are almost entirely of concrete, in a Cubist/Brutalist/Modernist style, and include a number of high-rise blocks. Built from the 1970s onwards, it was initially made up of town houses in grey brick; more recent builds are in red & yellow brick. It originally consisted of large, sprawling, concrete and red brick, eight- and nine-storey estates overlooking the A2041, and three-storey red-brick town houses. It has spread west of the A2041 and now also includes a number of red and yellow brick homes built from the 1990s onwards. Thamesmead West is in Greenwich near Woolwich and Plumstead (Between Whinchat Road, the A2016 & the banks of the river Thames) and was built from the 1990s onwards. It is a significant distance from the original development and consists mainly of medium density residential development with yellow brick fascias, with towers along the riverside.  Belmarsh Prison, Isis Prison and Thameside Prison are located on the western edge of the area, while the sewage processing works at Crossness, built in the Victorian era is on eastern edge of Thamesmead. The southern boundary is the covered Southern Outfall Sewer, which has been landscaped as an elevated footpath called the Ridgeway. Neighbouring areasNearby areas are: Barking & Dagenham (across the Thames), Belvedere, Abbey Wood, Plumstead, Welling, Woolwich, Bexleyheath, Erith and Greenwich. DemographyIn common with the rest of London, the ethnic make-up of Thamesmead has changed since it was first built. Initially, it was one of the most homogenous estates of its type in London, being predominately white and working class. The lack of London Underground services and at the very edge of the metropolis may have meant Thamesmead was not first port of call for immigrants arriving in London. The housing selection policy that favoured relatives of existing residents reinforced this aspectHowever, after the Fall of Saigon and the American withdrawal from Vietnam in the late 1970s, a small group of Vietnamese refugees built a community in the area. In the 1990s, another ultimately larger wave of emigration from West Africa (predominately Nigeria and Ghana) began. Thamesmead also adjoins the Thistlebrook travellers site which is situated just inside Abbey Wood.

Thus Thamesmead has no underground or surface rail links. Most residents rely on bus services to reach the nearest rail stations. There is a disused railway trackbed from Plumstead which once served the Royal Arsenal. The London Assembly proposed on 4 October 2016 to build an extension of the DLR from Gallions Reach to Thamesmead.  With a population of almost 32,000 it is one of London's largest districts without rail access. National RailThe nearest stations are Abbey Wood, Belvedere, Plumstead, Woolwich Arsenal and Woolwich Dockyard for Southeastern services towards Crayford, Dartford, Gillingham, Hither Green, London Cannon Street and London Charing Cross. Cycle PathsThe Ridgeway cycle path owned by Thames Water passes through the town from Plumstead Railway station to Crossness Sewage Treatment works, dividing the town into North and South Thamesmead. CultureThere are a wide variety of active community groups and local bands (The Bargains and a member of post-rock act From The Sky) and a short-range commercial radio station - 1068 Time FM - that grew from the original cable (subsequently FM) service "Radio Thamesmead"Places of worship in the area include the Thamesmead Ecumenical Parish, with shared buildings and co-operation by the Methodist Church, Church of England, United Reformed Church and Roman Catholic Church,  Lesnes Methodist Circuit, accessed 27 May 2008  and the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Goodnews Haven on Nathan way. Thamesmead were champions of the Kent League in 2007/08, and were then promoted to the Isthmian League Division One North. Thamesmead Town have a small but dedicated following that are known as The Thamesmead Hardcore. Thames Path Southeast Extension on TfL website, accessed 27 May 2008  Thamesmead is also one of the starting points of the Green Chain Walk, which links to places such as Chislehurst and Crystal Palace. Green Chain Walk website, accessed 27 May 2008 There is a combined swimming pool, fitness centre and library run by Greenwich Council and Greenwich Leisure Limited in Thamesmead Central (The Thamesmere Centre). Bexley Council run a library at Binsey Walk near Southmere Lake, and sailing and canoeing are run at Southmere Lake in Thamesmead South by Southmere Boating Centre (with Greenwich Yacht Club) and sailing only by the YMCA in association with Erith Yacht Club. Trust Thamesmead run an indoor climbing wall (The cave) near Southmere Lake. The Thamesview Golf Centre in Thamesmead North has a nine-hole course and driving range. Leisure & Sport page on Trust Thamesmead website, accessed 27 May 2008  Fishing at Birchmere Lake in Thamesmead West is organised by Thamesmead Town Angling Club. Fish include tench, bream, carp and pike. Birchmere Lake details on 'Go Fish' website, accessed 27 May 2008  Cultural referencesThamesmead estate was featured prominently in the film The Optimists of Nine Elms (1973) starring Peter Sellers. Thamesmead is seen as a new and better alternative through the eyes of two small children who live in older, dilapidated flats on the other side of the city.    The Tavy Bridge area of Thamesmead South, including Southmere Lake, was used as a setting for the Stanley Kubrick film A Clockwork Orange and also the play and Channel 4 gay coming-of-age film Beautiful Thing. Thamesmead on the 'Hidden London' website, accessed 27 May 2008  British TV Drama Misfits was also filmed in Thamesmead. Many scenes take place around Southmere Lake, while Bexley College was once also used as a setting.  The video of "Come to Daddy" by electronic musician Aphex Twin, directed by Chris Cunningham, was also shot in Thamesmead.  The Firm (1989) starring Gary Oldman was filmed in Thamesmead. 

London Borough of Enfield<====>94318<====>London Borough of Enfield  The London Borough of Enfield ( ) is a London borough in north London with some districts within the borough straddling north-east London, England. It borders the London Boroughs of Barnet (to the west), Haringey (to the south) and Waltham Forest (to the southeast), the districts of Hertsmere (to the northwest), Welwyn Hatfield and Broxbourne (both to the north) in Hertfordshire, and Epping Forest (to the east) in Essex. The local authority is Enfield Council. EtymologyEnfield was recorded in Domesday Book in 1086 as Enefelde, and as Einefeld in 1214, Enfeld in 1293, and Enfild in 1564: that is 'open land of a man called Ēana', or 'where lambs are reared', from the Old English feld with an Old English personal name or with Old English ēan 'lamb'. The feld would have been a reference to an area cleared of trees within woodland that would later become known as Enfield Chase.  HistoricalEnfield Town used to be a small market town in the county of Middlesex on the edge of the forest about a day's walk north of London. As London grew, Enfield Town and its surrounds eventually became a residential suburb, with fast transport links into central LondonThe current borough was created in 1965 from the former areas of the Municipal Borough of Southgate, the Municipal Borough of Enfield and the Municipal Borough of Edmonton. The armorial bearings of these three boroughs were also merged. The heraldic beast on the shield of the Enfield coat of arms is known in heraldry as an "Enfield" (or colloquially as the Enfield beast), and is used extensively as a logo representing Enfield, particularly by the borough councilIn Roman times, Enfield was connected to Londinium by Ermine Street, the great Roman road which stretched all the way up to York. Artefacts found in the early 1900s reveal that there were Roman settlements in the areas that are now Edmonton and Bush Hill ParkIn 790 King Offa of Mercia was recorded as giving the lands of Edmonton to St Albans Abbey. The area became strategically important as East Anglia was taken over by the Danes. In the 790s strongholds were built by men loyal to King Alfred the Great, in order to keep the Danes to the east of the River LeaAfter the Norman Conquest, both Enfield and Edmonton were mentioned in Domesday Book. Enfield is also described as having a "parc". This parc—a heavily forested area for hunting—was key to Enfield's existence in the Middle Ages (see Enfield Old Park). Wealthy Londoners came to Enfield first to hunt, and then to build houses in the green, wooded surroundings. In 1303, Edward I of England granted Enfield a charter to hold a weekly market, which has continued up to this day. Bowles for his garden at nearby Myddelton House, where it remains today. Nearby historically was the palace of Edward VI, where Elizabeth I lived while a princess, including during the final illness of Henry VIII. Edward was taken there to join her, so that in the company of his sister, Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford could break the news to Edward, formally announcing the death of their royal father in the presence chamber at Enfield, on his knees to make formal obeisance to the boy as King.  Later Elizabeth held court there when she was queen (this was remembered in the name Palace Gardens that was a street running behind Pearsons department store and is still recalled in the name of Enfield's shopping centre).   IndustryEnfield has a history of armaments manufacture—see Royal Small Arms Factory. The Lee–Enfield 303 rifle was standard issue for the British Army until 1957, although its usage carried on afterwards for some time. Other firearms manufactured there include the Bren and Sten machine guns—the "en" in both cases denoting the place of manufactureThe world's first solid state circuitry colour televisions were manufactured by Ferguson at their now closed plant in EnfieldThe first dishwasher to be mass-produced was in Hotpoint's now closed Enfield plantThe Barclays Bank branch in Enfield was the first place in the world to have an ATM or cash machine; it was officially opened in June 1967 by Reg Varney, a television actor and personality most famous for his lead role in the comedy series On the Buses. This historical event was marked by a silver plaque on the wall of the bank, which has since been vandalised/removed and replaced with an English Heritage Blue plaqueA fine example of a grade II listed art deco factory building can be found along Southbury Road, with the former Ripaults Factory,  now an office building for Travis Perkins. Enfield today The Borough's Civic Centre is located in Silver Street, Enfield Town and is home to the Council. Enfield Town is also home to the local credit union, North London Credit UnionIn 2007, Enfield Town centre completed a major redevelopment project under the name PalaceXchange while retaining the Palace Gardens Shopping Centre. This is still on-going, and provides new housing, health facilities, a new leisure centre, a supermarket, and many other civic featuresMany local activities are located around the A10 road, on the sites of former industrial enterprises, which has a number of large retail outlets and a large multiplex Cineworld cinema. Mantella, Pearsons, Argos etc) as well as others in the Enfield Retail Park being broken into and looted.  The Sony Distribution Centre in the Innova Business Park, near Waltham Cross, was burnt to the ground.  Although early reports questioned whether this was an arson or a coincidental incident arrests were later made in connection.  In September 2012, a year after the attack, a rebuilt Sony Distribution Centre was opened by the prime minister, David Cameron.   Governance    Elections to Enfield Council take place every four years, there are 21 wards in the borough and three councillors are returned to each ward. Of the current 63 councillors there are 39 Labour members, 22 Conservatives and two independents meaning the Labour Group currently controls the council. London Fire BrigadeThe London Borough of Enfield has three fire stations within its boundary; Edmonton, Enfield and Southgate. However, if an incident requires a higher attendance, appliances from throughout London can be mobilised to meet the needs of the area if required. Within the Borough of Enfield lies the North Middlesex Hospital, Shell Gases Ltd (amongst other chemical plants) plus several mainline and Underground stations. The three fire stations operate a total of five pumping appliances, one rescue tender, a command unit and a USAR unit. Of the three fire stations within the borough; Enfield is mobilised to the most incidents and has the largest station ground (the area of which Enfield is the first appliance to attend).

The playing fields were used as a POW camp for Italians during World War IIThe second largest playing fields are at Firs Farm on Firs Lane. There are a handful of rugby pitches along with more than a dozen football pitches. The pitches drain reasonably well but are generally in poor condition with old, rusted goalposts. The once successful football club, Enfield FC, were forced into a nomadic existence after the sale of their Southbury Road ground and became defunct at the end of the 2006/2007 season after years of ground sharing at many Hertfordshire based clubs. They finally found a ground in the borough when they merged with Brimsdown Rovers for the start of the 2011/2012 season.

Transport  In 1840 the first section of the Northern and Eastern Railway was opened from Stratford to Broxbourne, with stations at Water Lane (Angel Road) and Ponders End. Further stations were added in 1855 at Enfield Lock (Royal Small Arms Factory) and 1884 at Brimsdown. A branch line from Water Lane to Enfield Town was opened in 1849 serving Edmonton Low Level and Enfield Town. A further station was added in 1880 at Bush Hill Park. The direct line from London to Enfield Town was opened in 1872 with stations at Silver Street and Lower Edmonton (now called Edmonton Green). In 1891, a loop from Edmonton serving Southbury (Churchbury) and Turkey Street (Forty Hill) to Cheshunt on the main line was added. The Cheshunt and Enfield Town services are currently served by London OvergroundIn 1871 the Great Northern Railway opened its station on Windmill Hill. This was later replaced in 1910 when the line was extended to Cuffley. This section of railway is now part of the line commonly known as the Hertford Loop. Enfield is served by the Piccadilly line of the London Underground with stations at Arnos Grove, Southgate, Oakwood (named as Enfield West when it first opened) and Cockfosters (where the line terminates).

Thornton Heath<====>94319<====>Thornton Heath  Thornton Heath is a district of South London and part of the London Borough of Croydon. It is situated   south of Charing Cross. History Until the arrival of the railway in 1862, Thornton Heath was focused on an area 15 miles (24 km) south west of the Whitehorse manor house (now a school), at the locality on the main Sussex road A23 known as Thornton Heath Pond. Between the manor house and pond there was an isolated farmhouse. Eventually it would become the site for the railway station and the main expansion hubIn the 50-year period 1861–1911, Thornton Heath saw a complete transformation from isolated rural outpost to integrated metropolitan suburb. In its infancy, a new railway station sited in the eastern farmlands enabled that immediate area to evolve around a central point. In the late 19th century, the western part of Thornton Heath, which lay directly on the main London-Sussex road, demonstrated a classic form of suburban ribbon development. In the process, it became the final piece in an urban chain linking two major centres, London and Croydon, completing the greatest metropolitan expansion in the world at that time. GeographyThe nearest places are Mitcham, Croydon, South Norwood, Norbury, Pollards Hill, Selhurst, Upper Norwood and Eastfields.    TransportThere is a London Bus garage at the junction known as Thornton Heath Pond (although there is no longer a pond) where the A23 Brighton Road splits from the A236 Croydon road. The nearest railway stations are Thornton Heath, Norbury, Norwood Junction and Selhurst. Croydon's Tram system nearby has links to Wimbledon. Culture and architecture   Architecturally, Thornton Heath is predominantly Victorian in both its residential and commercial sectors. There are a number of imposing, even grand, buildings surviving from this period. Two examples are St Paul's Church and St Alban's Church. Built in 1889, it was the first church designed by the late Victorian architect Sir Ninian Comper. It is situated on a  busy junction (of Grange Road and the High Street), as can be seen in the photograph.    It cost £8m with £28m from the British National Lottery Good Causes Fund through Sport England.   DemographyThornton Heath has a high degree of ethnic diversity. In the 2011 census, the Thornton Heath ward was 25% White British, 21% Black Caribbean and 15% Black African.  Bensham Manor ward, which also covers areas of Thornton Heath, was 19% White British, 18% Black Caribbean, 13% Black African and 11% Indian.  Sport and leisureThornton Heath gained a new leisure centre in May 2004 which has proved popular.  The popularity was such that turnstiles had to be fitted to improve security.   The centre is owned by Croydon Council, but originally run by Parkwood Leisure,  and now run by Fusion Lifestyle in partnership with the council. Thornton Heath formerly had a Non-League football club, Croydon Athletic, who played at the Keith Tuckey Stadium; but the club ceased to exist at the end of the 2010-11 season. In 2012, fans of the club formed AFC Croydon Athletic, which plays at the Mayfield Stadium. In 2015 the club competed in the Southern Counties East League. Their grounds and clubhouse are located in Frant Road off Brigstock RoadThornton Heath is one of the railway stations used by visitors to Crystal Palace's Selhurst Park stadium. CommunityThornton Heath Community Action Team  was formed in 2014 by a group of residents and businesses. Its aim is to deliver projects to improve the area. This has included organising litter picks, planting of new plants, and a community Christmas tree.
