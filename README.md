# CSU_GitHub
This repository is meant to be a backup for my CSU code
Some of my CSU code already exists on GitHub, so those I will have saved as separate GitHub repositories and added as Submodules

For current projects, create a separate repository to be added as a submodule later.

To-do:
- figure out why submodules are not updating here when I change them on their own repository
