Here are the instructions to run my demo in order to see for yourself how the server is vulnerable to being crashed via a buffer overflow attack:

1. Open 2 seperate command prompts.
2. On your first command prompt, go to your fhttpd directory and run the command "sudo make" or "make"
3. Then, got to your server directory and run "./webserver 5000"
This will start your server on port 5000.
4. On your second command prompt, go to where my exploit1.sh and payload1 files are stored.
5. run the command "bash exploit1.sh"
6. Go back to your first command prompt. It should show that the server has crashed due to a segmentation fault.
