---------Descriptions---------
process_class.py- a data structure that represents a process. It's data can be altered, and it can be ran
table_class.py- a data structure that holds a list of processes
queue_class.py- a data structure that holds a queue of processes
infinite_class.py- a value that is always larger than the value compared to it
gantt_chart_class.py- provides methods to update your gantt chart as your processes run
info_chart_class.py- provides methods to calculate and print the information you need when the scheduling algorithm has finished running.
scheduling_class.py- contains methods to run all 3 scheduling algorithms and print their outputs
sch.py- runs the code
README.txt- this file. It contains descriptions of all my files, and answers to questions

----------Questions-----------
1. Shortest Remaining Time First is a preemptive scheduling algorithm.
2. New, Ready, Waiting, Running, Terminated.
3. Shortest Job First is like Priority Scheduling with the priority based on the burst time of the process.
4. Convoy Effect is the primary disadvantage of First Come First Serve Scheduling algorithm.
5. Multilevel Feedback queues prevent starvation by moving processes that have waited too long to a higher priority queue.
